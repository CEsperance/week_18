# week_18
1.	What is a neural network? What are the general steps required to build a neural network? 
2.	Generally, how do you check the performance of a neural network? Why? 
3.	Create a neural network using keras to predict the outcome of either of these datasets: 
Cardiac Arrhythmia: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia 
Abalone age: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone
4.	Write another algorithm to predict the same result as the previous question using either KNN or logistic regression.
5.	Create a neural network using pytorch to predict the same result as question 3. 
6.	Compare the performance of the neural networks to the other model you created. Which performed better? Why do you think that is?
